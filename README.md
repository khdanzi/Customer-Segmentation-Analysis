Customer Segmentation Analysis

Introduction
In today’s highly competitive ecommerce landscape, understanding customer behavior is vital for business success. Customer segmentation is a strategic approach that allows companies to group their customer base into distinct segments based on common characteristics such as purchase behavior, frequency, and value. By identifying these segments, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, enhance customer experience, and boost profitability.
This project focuses on performing customer segmentation analysis for an ecommerce company using data analytics techniques. By leveraging clustering algorithms like K-means, we aim to uncover meaningful patterns in customer behavior. The insights derived from this analysis will support data-driven decision-making in areas such as personalized marketing, product recommendations, and customer retention strategies.

Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

Data Collection and Preparation:
Acquire and preprocess a dataset containing customer demographics, transaction history, and behavioral metrics.

Data Exploration and Cleaning:
Understand the dataset’s structure, identify missing or inconsistent data, and clean the data for analysis.

Descriptive Statistical Analysis:
Compute essential statistics such as average purchase value, total spend, and purchase frequency to summarize customer behavior.

Customer Segmentation:
Apply clustering techniques (e.g., K-means) to segment customers based on their purchasing patterns and behaviors.

Visualization:
Create intuitive visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts, cluster maps) to present and interpret the customer segments.
